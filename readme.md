#Decode
I really like Raygun's Melville theme, so I used it on my blog after making tons of tweaks. I've further slimmed down an already pretty minimalist theme. This theme uses no raster images, and three vector images for the Twitter, Facebook, and Google+ icons. 

One should note that some parts of the theme, namely the `header.php` file have a few items hardcoded in, so before using this theme on a blog of your own, you should change that file however you like. 

My version of Melville–dubbed "Decode"–also supports link posts, where the title can be hyperlinked. To do this, first set the post format to "Link" and then add designate where the title should link to using a custom field entitled, `title_url`, `url_title`, or `url1`.
